			<h3>About</h3>
			<p> I currently work as an airport screening officer and did various professional roles in the past however, none of them satisified my creative side. 
				Enter UX Design. I enjoy this field as it builds on top of my natural creativity and artistry. I hope to combine all of my past experiences, business education alongside  
				all of the new technological skill sets I am developing to solve design problems in the workforce. I am always learning and growing, and would love an opportunity to grow with you! 

				Feel free to contact me.
